Notes: I just barely finished at the 4 hour mark so there are still a few bugs and I haven’t had a chance to go over my code much. Looking back I should probably not have broken into components since the moduralization wasn’t worth it for something of this scale. I was playing on adding a loading icon for API call button and refactoring the code to at least look vaguely 'production ready' if you squint.
